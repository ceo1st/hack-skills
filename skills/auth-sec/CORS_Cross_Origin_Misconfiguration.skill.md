# SKILL: CORS Misconfiguration — Credentialed Origins, Reflection, and Trust Boundary Errors

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Use this skill when browsers can access authenticated APIs cross-origin. Focus on reflected origins, credentialed requests, wildcard trust, parser mistakes, and origin allowlist bypasses.

## 1. WHEN TO LOAD THIS SKILL

Load when:

- Responses contain `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, or preflight headers
- A browser-based attack path might read authenticated API responses
- JSON endpoints appear protected from CSRF but are readable cross-origin

## 2. HIGH-VALUE MISCONFIGURATION CHECKS

| Theme | What to Check |
|---|---|
| wildcard with credentials | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` plus credential support or equivalent broken behavior |
| reflected origin | server echoes arbitrary `Origin` |
| weak allowlist | suffix, prefix, substring, regex, or mixed-case matching errors |
| `null` origin | acceptance of sandboxed, file, or serialized origins |
| preflight trust | overbroad methods and headers |
| internal API exposure | admin or tenant data readable cross-origin |

## 3. QUICK TRIAGE

1. Send crafted `Origin` headers and inspect reflection.
2. Test with and without credentials.
3. Probe allowlist bypasses using attacker subdomains and parser edge cases.
4. If readable data is sensitive, chain to account or tenant impact.
